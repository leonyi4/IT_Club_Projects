# Payap IT Club Community Guidelines

## Our Commitment

At Payap IT Club, we are dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone. We aim to foster an environment where diversity and different perspectives are respected and valued. This document outlines the expectations and standards for behavior within our community.

## Our Guidelines

1. **Be Respectful:** Treat all community members with respect and kindness. Disagreements are normal, but they should not turn into personal attacks or harassment.

2. **Inclusive Language:** Use inclusive language that is respectful of people from all backgrounds and identities. Avoid discriminatory, offensive, or harmful language.

3. **Be Collaborative:** We encourage collaboration and cooperation. Help others, share knowledge, and foster a supportive atmosphere.

4. **Stay On Topic:** Keep discussions and contributions on topic. If you have a new or unrelated issue, create a new thread or repository.

5. **Respect Privacy:** Do not share personal information about others without their consent. Respect the privacy of all community members.

6. **No Harassment:** Harassment and abusive behavior are not tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, threats, offensive comments, or unwanted advances.

7. **No Discrimination:** Discrimination, whether based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other factor, will not be tolerated.

8. **Reporting Violations:** If you witness or experience behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it to the <payapitclub@gmail.com>.

Violations of these guidelines may result in actions such as warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent banning from the community. Decisions will be made by the current club president and will be final.
